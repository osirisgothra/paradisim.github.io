{"name":"Paradisim Projects Back","tagline":"Subdivision Paradisim, LLC","body":"Welcome to PPB, this is place where all of my PPB projects can be found. All of my projects that are here are related to linux and usually run well under debian without much effort. If you find you need anything for a different OS, please feel free to request so. If you need even newer code (zero hour), you must visit the realtime homesite. This is located at http://paradisim.twilightparadox.com which is a private server that I run out of my attic :) \r\n\r\nI hope the tools & applications I develop will help, or at least that is my intention. If you need specific support, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at: osirisgothra@hotmail.com or sign up at the homesite and send me a message or comment via the blog or feedback pages. You can also get help at the Paradisim Forum located at my homesite.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
